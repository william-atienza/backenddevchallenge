# Back-End Developer Challenge 

In this challenge, the REST API contains information about a collection of movie released after the year 2010, directed by acclaimed directors.  
Given the threshold value, the goal is to use the API to get the list of the names of the directors with most movies directed. Specifically, the list of names of directors with movie count strictly greater than the given threshold.   
The list of names must be returned in alphabetical order.  

To access the collection of users perform HTTP GET request to:
https://wiremock.dev.eroninternational.com/api/movies/search?page=<pageNumber>
where <pageNumber> is an integer denoting the page of the results to return.

For example, GET request to:
https://wiremock.dev.eroninternational.com/api/movies/search?page=2
will return the second page of the collection of movies. Pages are numbered from 1, so in order to access the first page, you need to ask for page number 1.
The response to such request is a JSON with the following 5 fields:

- page: The current page of the results  
- per_page: The maximum number of movies returned per page.  
- total: The total number of movies on all pages of the result.  
- total_pages: The total number of pages with results.  
- data: An array of objects containing movies returned on the requested page  

Each movie record has the following schema:  
- Title: title of the movie  
- Year: year the movie was released  
- Rated: movie rating  
- Released: movie release date  
- Runtime: movie duration time in minutes  
- Genre: move genre  
- Director: movie director  
- Writer: movie writers  
- Actors: movie actors  

## Posible Solutions
### Clone repository and complete the Function
  
Complete the function:

    List<String> getDirectors(int threshold)

getDirectors has the following parameter:
- threshold: integer denoting the threshold value for the number movies a person has directed

The function must return a list of strings denoting the name of the directors whose number of movies directed is strictly greater than the given threshold. 
The directors name in the list must be ordered in alphabetical order.


#### Sample Input For Custom Testing
    4  
#### Sample Output
    Martin Scorsese
    Woody Allen
    
The threshold value is 4, so the result must contain directors names with more than 4 movies directed.   
There are 2 such directors and names in the alphabetical order listed in Sample Output.

### Alternative: Spring Boot solution

An alternative solution to clonning the repository and implementing the function can be creating a new Spring Boot project with Rest endpoint:       
```
/api/directors?threshold=X
```

Sample : `/api/directors?threshold=4`

Json response:
```
{  "directors": ["Martin Scorsese","Woody Allen"] }
```

The solution can be shared via .zip file or sharing a github repository url via email. 

#### Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness: Does the component correctly fetch and display movies data from the API?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, organized, and maintainable?
- Java Spring Best Practices: Does the candidate follow Java Spring best practices and principles?
- Bonus Points: Does the candidate implement any of the bonus features or additional
best practices?
- Describe on Readme.md if any improvement was left out and why

# Need Improvements:

1. More unit testing needed. Took me a lot of time already to fix the mocking of service class used in MainController.java. I used my old Spring Boot applications (v2) as reference but seems like the Spring Boot 3 is different now.
2. Need to add API contract testing to be able to catch breaking changes in the JSON schema. 
3. I only added a simple logging configuration as you can see in application.yaml (line 11). In prod, we usually need more complicated configurations specially for rolling logs.
4. I have not code coveraged my implementation.
5. Need to do some refactoring.
